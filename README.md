# RetinaVisionNet: Advancing Diabetes Retinopathy Detection with Explainable AI and Self-Attention Technique


Abstract
Diabetes Retinopathy, a leading cause of vision impairment, necessitates early and precise detection. Addressing this, we present RetinaVisionNet, a groundbreaking AI framework integrating explainable AI and self-attention mechanisms for enhanced diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. This model transcends traditional approaches by employing advanced self-attention techniques, significantly refining feature extraction from retinal images and elevating diagnostic accuracy. The emphasis on explainability ensures medical professionals can interpret and trust the model's outcomes, fostering clinical acceptance. Evaluated on a diverse dataset, RetinaVisionNet demonstrated outstanding performance. ROC AUC scores were impressive across DR stages: Mild (0.93), Moderate (0.92), No_DR (0.99), Proliferate_DR (0.91), Severe (0.93), with a micro-average of 0.97 and macro-average of 0.94. These scores affirm the model's consistent and reliable detection across DR categories. Moreover, RetinaVisionNet achieved a 95% accuracy rate, 94% precision, 95% recall, and a 93% F1-score, underscoring its efficacy and balanced precision-recall trade-off, crucial for clinical reliability. RetinaVisionNet exemplifies a significant stride in diabetic retinopathy detection, merging cutting-edge AI with a focus on explainability and clinical relevance. Its accuracy and interpretability show great potential for improving early diagnosis and patient outcomes in diabetic eye care.
